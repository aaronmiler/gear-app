Weather or Not - The Gear App
=============================

This summer I started riding my bike to work. I often found myself not sure what gear I should bring on a day to day basis, and was checking the forecast constantly. This application, given a date, location, and times. Checks the weather, and gives you suggestions of what gear you should bring on your ride or commute.

The application is currently living at [bike.labs.aaronmiler.com](http://bike.labs.aaronmiler.com)

This application uses the following services

- [Google Maps v3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)
- [Forecast.io](http://forecast.io/)
- [Geocoder](http://www.rubygeocoder.com/)
